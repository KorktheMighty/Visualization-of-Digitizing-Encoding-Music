This MATLAB code provides a a visualization of the process of digitizing and encoding music. 

The user has the option to use either a made piano or letting the computer randomly generate a short tune. These files are saved as
a WAV and named either "random_song" or "recorded_audio". The file named Part 3 will the visualization of the encoded music alongside 
how much of the signal in dB was loss. On the encoding program, Part 2, the fft and spectrogram of the audio are shown also.

This code was a final project for my class PHYS 465 - "Physics of Sound" and given with a presentation on the code and its purpose in
use.
